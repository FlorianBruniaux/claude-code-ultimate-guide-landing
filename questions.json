      "correct": "b",
      "explanation": "The `!` prefix executes shell commands immediately without asking Claude to do it. For example, `!git status` runs the command directly.

      "correct": "b",
      "explanation": "The `@` symbol references specific files in your prompts for targeted operations. For example, `Review @src/auth/login.tsx for security issues` signals Claude to read that file. This provides precision (target exact files), speed (skip file discovery), and clarity (makes your intent explicit). Claude reads the file on-demand via tools.",

      "correct": "b",
      "explanation": "The guide recommends a hybrid approach: use Copilot for quick autocomplete and boilerplate while using Claude Code for feature implementation, debugging, code reviews, and understanding unfamiliar codebases. This leverages the strengths of both tools - Copilot excels at inline suggestions while Claude Code handles multi-file operations and complex reasoning.",

      "correct": "b",
      "explanation": "Plan Mode is Claude Code's \"look but don't touch\" mode. It allows reading files, searching the codebase, analyzing architecture, and proposing approaches. It prevents editing files, running state-modifying commands, creating new files, and making commits. Perfect for safe exploration before making changes.",

      "explanation": "Ctrl+C cancels the current operation in Claude Code. This is useful for stopping long-running analysis or when Claude is taking an approach you don't want.

Instead of loading all tools upfront, it provides a Tool Search tool for on-demand discovery, dramatically reducing baseline context usage.\n\n**Example**: chrome-devtools MCP provides 26 tools consuming 17,000 tokens. With lazy loading, Claude only loads 3-5 relevant tools per query (~3K tokens)—a 91% reduction.",
