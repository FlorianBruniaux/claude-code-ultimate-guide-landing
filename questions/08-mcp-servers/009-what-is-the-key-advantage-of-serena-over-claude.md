What is the key advantage of Serena over Claude Code's built-in tools?

---

Serena fills a critical gap: Claude Code has no built-in indexation (unlike Cursor).

Serena provides:
- **Indexation**: Pre-indexes your codebase for efficient symbol lookup
- **Project Memory**: Stores context between sessions
- **Onboarding**: Auto-analyzes project structure on first run

For large codebases (>10k lines), Serena's indexation dramatically improves performance.
