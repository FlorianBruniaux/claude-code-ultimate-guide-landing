What is the main philosophy behind using complementary AI tools with Claude Code?

---

The philosophy is "augmentation, not replacement."

Claude Code excels at contextual reasoning and implementation, but has gaps:
- No real-time web search with source verification
- No image generation
- No PowerPoint/slide generation
- No audio synthesis

The goal is to chain the right tool for each step of your workflow.
