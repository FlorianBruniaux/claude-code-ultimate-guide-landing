What are the 3 documented external orchestration systems for multi-agent Claude Code?

---

Three documented external orchestration systems:

1. **Gas Town** (Steve Yegge) - Multi-agent coordination with shared context
2. **multiclaude** (dlorenc) - Parallel Claude Code instances with task distribution
3. **agent-chat** (Justin Abrahms) - Inter-agent communication protocol

These are community-built tools, not official Anthropic products. Each solves multi-agent coordination differently.
