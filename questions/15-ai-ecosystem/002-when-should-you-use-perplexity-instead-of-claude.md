When should you use Perplexity instead of Claude Code?

---

Perplexity excels at research with verified sources.

Use Perplexity for:
- "What's the latest API for X?" (real-time info)
- "Compare 5 libraries for auth" (sourced comparisons)
- Deep Research mode synthesizes 100+ sources

Use Claude Code for:
- Implementation in your codebase
- Contextual code explanation
- Multi-file editing
