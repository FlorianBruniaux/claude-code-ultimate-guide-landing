How many core tools does Claude Code have?

---

Claude Code has exactly 8 core tools: Bash (universal adapter), Read (file contents), Edit (modify files), Write (create/overwrite), Grep (search contents), Glob (find files), Task (sub-agents), and TodoWrite (progress tracking). That's the entire arsenal.
