What are the three components of 'The Trinity' pattern?

---

The Trinity is the most powerful Claude Code pattern combining:

1. **Plan Mode** - Safe exploration without changes
2. **Extended Thinking** - Deep analysis (enabled by default in Opus 4.5)
3. **Sequential Thinking (MCP)** - Structured multi-step reasoning

Combined, these provide maximum understanding before taking action.
Use for architecture decisions, complex debugging, and legacy modernization.
