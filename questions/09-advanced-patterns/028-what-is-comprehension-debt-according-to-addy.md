What is 'comprehension debt' according to Addy Osmani's '80% Problem'?

---

Comprehension debt is code you shipped but don't fully understand. It's distinct from technical debt (code you understand but know is suboptimal). With AI-generated code, comprehension debt grows silently: you accept suggestions without deep understanding. The fix: always be able to explain WHY, not just WHAT.
