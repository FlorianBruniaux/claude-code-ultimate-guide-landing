The guide recommends progressive learning:

1. **Week 1**: Basic commands, context management
2. **Week 2**: CLAUDE.md, permissions
3. **Week 3**: Agents and commands
4. **Month 2+**: MCP servers, advanced patterns

Start with simple, low-risk tasks and build up complexity gradually.
This avoids overwhelm and builds solid fundamentals.
