What is the '4-step cycle' for CLAUDE.md as compounding memory (Boris Cherny)?

---

Boris Cherny's mental model for CLAUDE.md as compounding memory:

1. **Error** - Claude makes a mistake
2. **Rule** - You add a rule to CLAUDE.md preventing it
3. **Read** - Claude reads CLAUDE.md on every session start
4. **Never repeated** - The mistake never happens again

Goal: never correct Claude twice for the same mistake. CLAUDE.md compounds over time.
