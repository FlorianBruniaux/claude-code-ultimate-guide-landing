What is the '4-step cycle' for CLAUDE.md as compounding memory?

---

The guide interprets Boris Cherny's concept of CLAUDE.md as "compounding memory" into a 4-step cycle:

1. **Error** - Claude makes a mistake
2. **Rule** - You add a rule to CLAUDE.md preventing it
3. **Read** - Claude reads CLAUDE.md on every session start
4. **Never repeated** - The mistake never happens again

Boris Cherny states: "I treat Claude.md as compounding memory: every mistake becomes a durable rule for the team." The 4-step framework is the guide's interpretation of this principle, not an explicit quote from Boris.
