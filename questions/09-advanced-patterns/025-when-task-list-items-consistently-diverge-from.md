When task list items consistently diverge from actual work done, what does the guide recommend?

---

Task list divergence is diagnostic, not failure. Patterns reveal issues:

- **Too broad** tasks → break down into smaller pieces
- **Too narrow** tasks → step back and think bigger
- **Wrong priorities** → re-align tasks with actual goals
- **Consistent drift** → your mental model of the problem is wrong

Use divergence as signal, not noise.
