What is 'Context Engineering' as a methodology?

Context Engineering treats context as a design element. Key concepts: Progressive Disclosure (let agent discover incrementally), Memory Management (conversation vs persistent memory), Dynamic Refresh (rewrite TODO list before response). High Claude fit (⭐⭐⭐) for long sessions.
