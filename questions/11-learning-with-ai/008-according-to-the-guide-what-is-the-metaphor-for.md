According to the guide, what is the metaphor for AI in development?

---

AI is compared to GPS: great for getting somewhere fast, dangerous if you lose the ability to navigate without it, truly useful when you understand the map AND use the GPS. A developer who only copy-pastes AI output is like a driver who can't read a map - fine until the GPS fails or someone asks for directions.
