What are the 3 failure modes identified in Addy Osmani's '80% Problem' of agentic coding?

---

Addy Osmani's "80% Problem" identifies 3 failure modes:

1. **Overengineering** - AI adds unnecessary complexity (abstraction layers, premature optimization)
2. **Assumption propagation** - One wrong assumption cascades through the codebase
3. **Sycophantic agreement** - AI agrees with bad ideas instead of pushing back

The 80% refers to AI getting you 80% of the way, with the last 20% requiring deep human understanding.
