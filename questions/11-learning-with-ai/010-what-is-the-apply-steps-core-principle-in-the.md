What is the 'Apply' step's core principle in the UVAL protocol?

The Apply step requires modification, not copy-paste. You must change at least one element (variable name, structure, edge case handling). Why? Modification forces understanding. Copying is passive; modifying requires you to engage with the code and understand how it works.
