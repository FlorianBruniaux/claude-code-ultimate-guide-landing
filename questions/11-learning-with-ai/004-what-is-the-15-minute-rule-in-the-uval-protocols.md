What is the '15-Minute Rule' in the UVAL protocol's 'Understand First' step?

---

The 15-minute rule is a specific protocol: (1) State the problem in ONE sentence (2 min), (2) Brainstorm 3 possible approaches (5 min), (3) Identify your knowledge gaps (3 min), (4) THEN ask AI with a much better question (5 min). This forces you to think before asking, resulting in better questions and faster learning.
