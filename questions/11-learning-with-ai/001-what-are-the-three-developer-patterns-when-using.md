What are the three developer patterns when using AI, according to the Learning with AI guide?

---

The three patterns are: Dependent (copy-paste without understanding, can't debug AI code), Avoidant (refuses AI on principle, slower than peers), and Augmented (uses AI critically, understands everything). The goal is to become Augmented - using AI for leverage while maintaining deep understanding.
