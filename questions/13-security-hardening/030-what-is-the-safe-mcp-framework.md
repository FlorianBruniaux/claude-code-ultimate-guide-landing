What is the SAFE-MCP framework?

---

SAFE-MCP (safemcp.org) is a comprehensive security framework that maps 80+ attack techniques to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically adapted for MCP environments. It provides policy-based blocklists and defensive recommendations. Combined with tools like mcp-scan, Docker MCP Gateway, and Snyk AI-BOM, it forms part of a defense-in-depth strategy for securing AI agent infrastructure.
