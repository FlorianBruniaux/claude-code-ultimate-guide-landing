What is an example of a BAD agent description?

---

"Backend stuff" is a bad description - it's too vague to help Claude know when to activate the agent. Good descriptions are specific: "Use when designing APIs, reviewing database schemas, or optimizing backend performance" or "Security code reviewer - use PROACTIVELY when reviewing auth code." Clear activation triggers improve agent utilization.
