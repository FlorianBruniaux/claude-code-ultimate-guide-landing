What is 'Tool SEO' in agent design?

---

Tool SEO optimizes the agent's description field to improve auto-activation. Techniques include: using "use PROACTIVELY" to encourage automatic activation, listing explicit trigger keywords, describing specific contexts, and adding short nicknames. A good description: "Security code reviewer - use PROACTIVELY when: reviewing auth code, analyzing API endpoints... Triggers: security, auth, vulnerability, OWASP"
