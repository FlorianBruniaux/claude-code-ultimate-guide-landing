What are agents in Claude Code?

---

Agents are specialized sub-processes (AI personas) that Claude can delegate tasks to. They encapsulate domain expertise, like a security reviewer knowing OWASP Top 10 or a backend architect understanding API design. Think of them as "expert consultants" - instead of explaining everything in your prompt, you invoke an agent that already has that expertise.
