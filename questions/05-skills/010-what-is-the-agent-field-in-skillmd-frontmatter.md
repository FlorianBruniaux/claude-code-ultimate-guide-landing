What is the 'agent' field in SKILL.md frontmatter?

---

The `agent` field indicates whether the skill is 'specialist' (domain-focused, deep expertise in one area) or 'general' (broad, applicable across domains). Specialist skills like security-guardian provide deep domain knowledge, while general skills might provide widely-applicable patterns or utilities.
