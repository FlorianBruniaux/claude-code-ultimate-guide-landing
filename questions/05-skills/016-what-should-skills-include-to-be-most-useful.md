What should skills include to be most useful?

---

Useful skills include: methodology steps (clear process to follow), checklists (verification items with checkboxes), good/bad code examples (showing correct patterns and anti-patterns), and reference material. This combination provides both theoretical knowledge and practical guidance that agents can apply directly to tasks.
