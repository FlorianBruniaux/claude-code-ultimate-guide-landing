What should you ALWAYS do before accepting a code change from Claude?

---

Always read the diff before accepting changes - this is your safety net. The guide emphasizes this as critical: "Always review diffs before accepting changes." While running tests is good practice, reviewing the diff is the immediate required step before any acceptance. You need to understand what changes are being proposed.
