When should you use auto-accept mode in Claude Code?

---

Auto-accept mode should only be used for well-defined, reversible operations. The guide warns: "Only use auto-accept for well-defined, reversible operations." It's dangerous for complex or risky changes. Default mode (asking permission) is safest, especially for learning and production work.
