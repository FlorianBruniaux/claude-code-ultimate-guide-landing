What image formats does Claude Code support for visual analysis?

---

Claude Code supports PNG, JPG, JPEG, WebP, and static GIF formats. You can paste images directly in the terminal (Cmd+V/Ctrl+V), drag and drop, or reference by path. This is useful for implementing UI from mockups, debugging visual issues, analyzing diagrams, and accessibility audits. Note that images consume significant context tokens (1000-2000 words equivalent).
