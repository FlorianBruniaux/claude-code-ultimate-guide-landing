What is the recommended approach when migrating from GitHub Copilot to Claude Code?

---

The guide recommends a hybrid approach: use Copilot for quick autocomplete and boilerplate while using Claude Code for feature implementation, debugging, code reviews, and understanding unfamiliar codebases. This leverages the strengths of both tools - Copilot excels at inline suggestions while Claude Code handles multi-file operations and complex reasoning.
