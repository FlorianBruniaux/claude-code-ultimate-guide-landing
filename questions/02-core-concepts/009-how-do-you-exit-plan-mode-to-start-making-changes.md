How do you exit Plan Mode to start making changes?

---

Use /execute to exit Plan Mode and begin implementing changes. While in Plan Mode, Claude can only read and analyze - no modifications are allowed. You can also respond to Claude's prompt "Ready to implement this plan?" to transition. This staged approach ensures you understand the plan before execution.
