What is OpusPlan mode?

---

OpusPlan uses Opus for planning (with superior reasoning capabilities) and automatically switches to Sonnet for implementation (more cost-efficient). Enable with `/model opusplan`. This provides Opus-quality planning while preserving tokens through Sonnet-speed execution. Particularly valuable for Pro subscribers with limited Opus tokens.
