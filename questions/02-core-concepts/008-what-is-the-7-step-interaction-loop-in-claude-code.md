What is the 7-step interaction loop in Claude Code?

---

The interaction loop is: 1) DESCRIBE - explain what you need, 2) ANALYZE - Claude explores the codebase, 3) PROPOSE - Claude suggests changes (diff), 4) REVIEW - you read and evaluate, 5) DECIDE - Accept/Reject/Modify, 6) VERIFY - run tests, check behavior, 7) COMMIT - save changes (optional). The key insight: you remain in control throughout.
