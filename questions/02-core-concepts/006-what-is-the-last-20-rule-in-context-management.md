What is the 'Last 20% Rule' in context management?

---

The Last 20% Rule recommends reserving approximately 20% of your context for: multi-file operations at end of session, last-minute corrections, and generating summary/checkpoint documents. This buffer ensures you can complete your work properly even as context fills up.
