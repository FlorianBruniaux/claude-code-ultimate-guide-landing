      <div class="faq-list">
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Which AI tools complement Claude Code?</summary>
          <p>Claude Code excels at implementation but works best in an ecosystem: <strong>Perplexity</strong> for deep research with verified sources, <strong>Gemini</strong> for visual understanding (design &rarr; code), <strong>NotebookLM</strong> for audio synthesis and doc review, <strong>v0/Bolt</strong> for rapid UI prototyping, <strong>Cursor/Copilot</strong> for inline autocomplete, and <strong>Wispr Flow</strong> for voice-to-text (4x faster than typing). Chain them: Research (Perplexity) &rarr; Implement (Claude Code) &rarr; Deliver (Kimi for slides).

        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How do I use voice-to-text with Claude Code?</summary>
          <p>Use tools like <strong>Wispr Flow</strong> or Superwhisper to dictate prompts ~4x faster than typing (150 WPM vs 40 WPM). These tools transcribe your speech directly into the terminal. The <a href="https://github.com/FlorianBruniaux/claude-code-ultimate-guide/blob/main/guide/ai-ecosystem.md#7-voice-to-text-wispr-flow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI Ecosystem guide</a> covers setup and integration patterns.</p>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How much should I trust AI-generated code?</summary>
          <p>Trust varies by risk level: <strong>auto-accept</strong> boilerplate and repetitive patterns, <strong>review</strong> business logic and non-trivial changes, <strong>manually verify</strong> security-critical code. Research shows even experienced developers miss bugs in AI code.
