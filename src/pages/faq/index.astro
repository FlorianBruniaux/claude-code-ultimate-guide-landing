The quality risk is real but more narrowly scoped than often claimed. Trust calibration: auto-accept boilerplate and repetitive patterns, review all business logic and non-trivial changes, manually verify security-critical code. Use TDD to catch errors early: write tests first, then let Claude implement."

          <summary>What is a CLAUDE.md file?</summary>
          <p>CLAUDE.md is a project memory file that gives Claude persistent context. Place it in your project root with tech stack, coding conventions, and build commands. Claude reads it automatically at session start. There are 3 levels: <code>~/.claude/CLAUDE.md</code> (global), project root (team-shared), and <code>.claude/CLAUDE.local.md</code> (personal, gitignored).

          <p><strong>Agents</strong> are AI personas with specific expertise (code-reviewer, security-auditor) defined in <code>.claude/agents/</code>. <strong>Skills</strong> are reusable capability modules with bundled resources, invoked via <code>/skill-name</code>. <strong>Commands</strong> are simple slash-command templates in <code>.claude/commands/</code> for repetitive tasks.

          <summary>How much should I trust AI-generated code?</summary>
          <p>Research shows AI-assisted code can contain <strong>1.75x more logic errors</strong> than human-written code (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3716848" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACM 2025 study</a>). <strong>Nuance:</strong> a 2-phase blind RCT (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00788" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Borg et al., 2025, n=151 professional developers</a>) found no significant difference in downstream maintainability — colleagues who evolve AI-generated code are not measurably slower than with human-written code. The quality risk is real but more narrowly scoped than often claimed. Trust calibration: <strong>auto-accept</strong> boilerplate and repetitive patterns, <strong>review</strong> business logic and non-trivial changes, <strong>manually verify</strong> security-critical code. Use TDD to catch errors early: write tests first, then let Claude implement.</p>
