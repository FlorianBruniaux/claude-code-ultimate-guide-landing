## RTK: Upstream filtering

RTK (Rust Token Killer) intercepts command outputs **before** they enter Claude's context. It is not a post-hoc summary, it is a filter that eliminates structurally redundant noise.

```bash
# Installation
brew install rtk
# or: cargo install --git https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk

# Inspect configuration changes before installing the integration
rtk init --dry-run
rtk init
```

## Measure output reduction

Compare equivalent commands on the same repository state, inspect failures, and use `rtk gain` for local estimates. Smaller shell output is only one contributor to token usage; it does not establish an equal reduction in the total bill. RTK estimates token counts rather than running the model's tokenizer. See the [RTK savings explanation](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk#how-savings-work).

## Essential RTK commands

```bash
rtk git status        # Condensed git
rtk git log           # Clean log output
rtk cargo test        # Filtered Rust tests
rtk vitest run        # Condensed JS tests
rtk gh pr view 123    # Optimized GitHub PR
rtk gain              # Savings dashboard
```

## Compact: Freeing up context

`/compact` summarizes conversation history. The recovered space varies and details can be lost; preserve decisions and next steps in files and inspect `/context` before continuing.

```
/compact              # Summarize the current session
```

The difference from `/clear`: compact preserves session continuity, clear starts from scratch.

## Limit reads and search scope

Claude Code does not document a native `.claudeignore` mechanism. Name the relevant directories in requests. Where access must be blocked, use permission rules in `.claude/settings.json`, for example:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": ["Read(./node_modules/**)", "Read(./dist/**)"]
  }
}
```

Review shell and MCP access separately. These rules are access restrictions, not a ranking hint for search. See [permission patterns](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions#read-and-edit).

## Efficient prompt rules

**Target, don't load:**
- "Check the `login` function in `auth.ts:45-60`" rather than "Check auth.ts for issues"
- Reference symbols (`calculateTotal`) rather than entire files
- Avoid pasting large JSON blobs or raw logs into the prompt

**What consumes the most:**

| Action | What to measure |
|--------|-----------------|
| Reading a large file | Returned text size |
| MCP call | Tool schemas and returned result |
| Long conversation | History retained in context |
| Test run | Output returned, including failures |

## Combined strategy

Filter verbose shell output, compact when useful, and restrict reads to relevant sources. Verify the resulting output still contains the evidence needed to complete the task.

Whole-task measurements of RTK alone differ by study: JetBrains measured +7.6% median cost per task at low reasoning effort and +0.1% at high effort, Dasein +13% total cost, THOL +7.1% with an interval that crosses zero, and Codepointer's replay -0.5% of spend. RTK's maintainers dispute the JetBrains design and report -4.8% on 13 dev tasks (p = 0.305) in their own re-run. Details: https://cc.bruniaux.com/token-savings/
