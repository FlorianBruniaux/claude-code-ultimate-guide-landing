## The Four Layers

| Layer | Responsibility | Does not replace |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| Model | Proposes text and tool calls | Permission and recovery |
| Runtime harness | Runs the loop and tools | Repository contract |
| Repository harness | Instructions, state, verification | Runtime loop |
| Orchestrator | Coordinates runtimes and sessions | Each runtime's decisions |

An orchestrator can launch several runtimes without owning their loops. A repository can improve its contract without changing runtime.

## Choose in the Right Order

1. Define the task and acceptable autonomy.
2. Select a runtime that owns the required loop.
3. Write the repository contract: instructions, pass criteria, verification.
4. Add an orchestrator only when coordination, isolation, or recovery across tasks requires it.

## Four Sources, Four Uses

| Source | Used to | Limit |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Strict comparison | Identify runtimes | Not a universal ranking |
| Orchestrator table | Compare coordination | Not a runtime |

## Short Trial, Traceable Verdict

Compare two or three candidates on real tasks in separate worktrees. Measure human verdict, interventions, plan drift, wall time, accepted-task cost, recovery, and setup friction.
