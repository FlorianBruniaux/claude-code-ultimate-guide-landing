What should a Security Guardian skill include for OWASP coverage?

---

A Security Guardian skill should include detailed checklists for each OWASP Top 10 category: A01 Broken Access Control (check authorization, IDOR, privilege escalation), A02 Cryptographic Failures (hardcoded secrets, TLS, password hashing), A03 Injection (SQL, NoSQL, XSS), etc. Each category should have specific verification items with checkboxes.
