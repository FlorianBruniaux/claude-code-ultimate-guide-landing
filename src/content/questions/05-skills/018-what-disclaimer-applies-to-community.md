What disclaimer applies to community cybersecurity skills?

---

Community cybersecurity skills come with important disclaimers: test thoroughly before using in production assessments, ensure you have proper authorization before penetration testing, review and validate against your organization's security policies, use only in legal contexts with written permission from system owners, and contribute back if you find issues. Verification is essential for any security tooling.
