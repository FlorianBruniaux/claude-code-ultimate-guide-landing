What is the REQUIRED file in a skill folder?

---

SKILL.md is the required main file in every skill folder. Optional files include: reference.md (detailed documentation), checklists/ (verification lists), examples/ (code patterns with good/bad examples), and scripts/ (helper scripts). SKILL.md contains the frontmatter and core instructions for the skill.
