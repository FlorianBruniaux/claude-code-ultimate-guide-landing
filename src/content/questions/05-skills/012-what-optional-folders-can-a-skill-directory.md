What optional folders can a skill directory contain?

---

A skill directory can contain: SKILL.md (required), reference.md (detailed documentation), checklists/ (verification lists like security.md, performance.md), examples/ (code patterns like good-example.ts, bad-example.ts), and scripts/ (helper scripts like audit.sh). This rich structure supports comprehensive domain knowledge.
