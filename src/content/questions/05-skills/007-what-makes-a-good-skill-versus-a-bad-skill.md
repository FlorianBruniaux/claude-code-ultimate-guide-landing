What makes a GOOD skill versus a BAD skill?

---

Good skills are: reusable across multiple agents, domain-focused (not too broad), contain reference material and checklists, and include verification steps. Bad skills are: specific to only one agent, too broad in scope, just instructions without reference material, and missing verification checklists.
