How can MCP servers work together effectively?

---

MCP servers can be combined for powerful workflows:

1. **Context7** - Get official pattern for auth
2. **Serena** - Find existing auth code in codebase
3. **Sequential** - Analyze how to integrate
4. **Playwright** - Test the implementation

This combination leverages each server's strengths for comprehensive development.
