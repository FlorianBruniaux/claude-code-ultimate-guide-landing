Which MCP server is best for looking up official library documentation?

---

Context7 is designed for accessing official library documentation.

Use Context7 when:
- Learning new libraries
- Finding correct API usage
- Checking official patterns

For example, "How does React useEffect work?" should use Context7
to get the official documentation rather than generic knowledge.
