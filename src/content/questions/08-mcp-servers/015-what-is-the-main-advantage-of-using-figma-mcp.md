What is the main advantage of using Figma MCP over screenshots?

---

Figma MCP provides 3-10x fewer tokens than screenshots because it returns structured data (React+Tailwind structure, design tokens) instead of requiring image analysis. Other benefits: direct token access, component mapping via Code Connect, iterative workflow without new screenshots.
