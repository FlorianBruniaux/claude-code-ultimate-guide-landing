What is the recommended rule of thumb for choosing between Claude Code and autocomplete tools based on code size?

---

The guide provides clear guidance: less than 5 lines of code - use Copilot/autocomplete; 5-50 lines in a single file - either tool works; more than 50 lines or multi-file changes - use Claude Code. This helps you choose the right tool for the task's complexity level.
