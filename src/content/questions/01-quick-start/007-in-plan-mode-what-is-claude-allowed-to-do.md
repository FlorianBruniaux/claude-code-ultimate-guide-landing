In Plan Mode, what is Claude allowed to do?

---

Plan Mode is Claude Code's "look but don't touch" mode. It allows reading files, searching the codebase, analyzing architecture, and proposing approaches. It prevents editing files, running state-modifying commands, creating new files, and making commits. Perfect for safe exploration before making changes.
