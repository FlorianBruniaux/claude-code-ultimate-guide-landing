Which tool is described as Claude's 'swiss-army knife' and 'universal adapter'?

---

Bash is Claude's swiss-army knife. It can run any CLI tool (git, npm, docker, curl...), execute scripts, chain commands with pipes, and access system state. The model has been trained on massive amounts of shell data, making it highly effective as a universal adapter.
