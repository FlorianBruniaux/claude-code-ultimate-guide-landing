What is a 'Permutation Framework' in Claude Code?

---

A Permutation Framework uses CLAUDE.md to drive systematic variation testing. The workflow: define variation dimensions (e.g., algorithm choice, data structure, caching strategy), generate all combinations, implement each variant, evaluate with metrics. This ensures you explore the solution space methodically rather than picking the first approach.
