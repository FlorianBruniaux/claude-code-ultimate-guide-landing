What is the key insight of 'Todo as Instruction Mirrors'?

---

The Mirror Principle: What you write as a todo becomes Claude's instruction.

Bad (vague todo -> vague execution):
"Fix the bug"

Good (specific todo -> precise execution):
"Fix null pointer in getUserById when user not found - return null instead of throwing"

Well-crafted todos guide Claude's execution with precision.
