What is 'Vibe Coding' according to the guide?

---

Vibe Coding is rapid prototyping through natural conversation.

When to vibe code:
- Early exploration: Testing if an approach works
- Proof of concept: Quick validation before full implementation
- Learning: Understanding a new library or pattern

Rules:
- No production code - exploration only
- Throw away freely
- Focus on learning
- Signal clearly: "This is vibe code, not for production"
