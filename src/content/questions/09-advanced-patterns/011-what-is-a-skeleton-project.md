What is a Skeleton Project?

---

A skeleton project is a minimal, working template that establishes patterns.

Skeleton principles:
1. **It must run**: `pnpm dev` works from day 1
2. **One complete vertical**: Full stack for one feature
3. **Patterns, not features**: Shows HOW, not WHAT
4. **Minimal dependencies**: Only what's needed

Progression: Skeleton (Day 1) -> MVP (Week 1) -> Full (Month 1)
