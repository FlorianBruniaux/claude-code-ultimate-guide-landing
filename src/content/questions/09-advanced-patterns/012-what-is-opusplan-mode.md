What is OpusPlan mode?

---

OpusPlan mode combines model strengths:
- **Planning**: Opus for high-level thinking
- **Execution**: Sonnet for implementation

This provides strategic thinking + cost-effective execution.

```bash
/model opusplan
Shift+Tab x 2  # Enter Plan Mode (Opus)
# Design architecture...
Shift+Tab      # Exit Plan Mode (Sonnet)
# Implement the plan...
```
