---

Mechanic Stacking layers 5 techniques for maximum Claude Code power:

1. **Plan Mode** - Safe exploration without changes
2. **Extended Thinking** - Deep internal reasoning
3. **Rev the Engine** - Progressive warm-up prompts
4. **Split-Role** - Separate architect/implementer/reviewer
5. **Permutation** - Systematic variation testing

Each layer compounds the previous one's effectiveness.
