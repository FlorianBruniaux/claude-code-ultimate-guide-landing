What does a Debugger agent's methodology typically include?

---

A systematic Debugger agent follows: 1) Reproduce - confirm the issue exists, 2) Isolate - narrow down to smallest reproducible case, 3) Analyze - read code, check logs, trace execution, 4) Hypothesize - form theories about cause, 5) Test - verify hypothesis with minimal changes, 6) Fix - implement solution, 7) Verify - confirm fix works without breaking other things. Never guess - always verify.
