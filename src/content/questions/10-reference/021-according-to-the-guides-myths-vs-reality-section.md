According to the guide's 'Myths vs Reality' section, what is the truth about 'hidden Claude Code features'?

---

The Myths vs Reality section debunks the "hidden features" myth. Anthropic uses progressive rollout (features gradually enabled for users) rather than secret flags or hidden configurations. All features are documented in release notes. There is no secret power-user mode.
