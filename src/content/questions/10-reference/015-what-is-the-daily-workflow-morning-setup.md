What is the daily workflow morning setup according to the guide?

---

Morning setup workflow:

1. Git pull latest changes
2. Review context with `/status`
3. Load project memory (`/sc:load` if using Serena)
4. Review yesterday's progress

This ensures you start with fresh code and full context awareness.
