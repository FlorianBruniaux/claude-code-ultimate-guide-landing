At what context percentage should you use /compact?

---

Use /compact when context reaches 70-90% (the red zone). The context zones are: Green (0-50%) - work freely; Yellow (50-75%) - start being selective; Red (75-90%) - use /compact; Critical (90%+) - must /clear or risk errors. Using /compact at 70% reduces usage by approximately 50% while preserving key context.
