What are symptoms of context depletion?

---

Context depletion symptoms include: shorter responses than usual (warning), forgetting CLAUDE.md instructions (serious), inconsistencies with earlier conversation (critical), errors on code already discussed (critical), and "I can't access that file" for files already read (critical). When critical symptoms appear, start a new session immediately.
