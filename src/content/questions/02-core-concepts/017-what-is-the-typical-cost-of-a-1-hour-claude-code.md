What is the typical cost of a 1-hour Claude Code session?

---

A typical 1-hour session costs $0.10 - $0.50 depending on usage patterns. The guide provides cost budgets: quick task (5-10 min) $0.05-$0.10, feature work (1-2 hours) $0.20-$0.50, deep refactor (half day) $1.00-$2.00. Spending $0.50 to save 30 minutes provides 60x ROI if your time is worth $30/hour - don't over-optimize!
