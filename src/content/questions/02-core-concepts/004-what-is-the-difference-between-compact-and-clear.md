What is the difference between /compact and /clear?

---

/compact summarizes the conversation, preserving key context while reducing usage by approximately 50%. Use it when running low on context. /clear starts completely fresh, losing all context - use it when changing topics or context is severely bloated. Choose based on whether you need to maintain continuity.
