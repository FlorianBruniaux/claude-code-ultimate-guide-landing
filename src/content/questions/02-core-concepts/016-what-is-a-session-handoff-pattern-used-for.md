What is a 'Session Handoff Pattern' used for?

---

The Session Handoff Pattern creates a document to bridge gaps between sessions. It includes: what was accomplished, current state, decisions made, next steps, and context for the next session. Create handoffs at end of work day, before context limit, when switching focus areas, or during interruptions. Store in `claudedocs/handoffs/handoff-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
