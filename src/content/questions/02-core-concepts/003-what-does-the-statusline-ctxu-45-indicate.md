What does the statusline 'Ctx(u): 45%' indicate?

---

The statusline metric 'Ctx(u): 45%' shows you've used 45% of your context window. The full statusline format is: `Claude Code | Ctx(u): 45% | Cost: $0.23 | Session: 1h 23m`. Monitoring this helps you know when to use /compact or /clear before context-related issues occur.
