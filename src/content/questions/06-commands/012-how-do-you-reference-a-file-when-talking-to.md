How do you reference a file when talking to Claude Code?

---

The `@filename` syntax references a file in your conversation with Claude.

Quick actions:
- `@file` - Reference a file
- `!command` - Run a shell command
- `Ctrl+C` - Cancel operation
- `Ctrl+R` - Retry last

This allows you to easily bring specific files into context for Claude to analyze.
