Which command enters Plan Mode for safe, read-only exploration?

---

The `/plan` command enters Plan Mode, where Claude can analyze and explore
the codebase without making any changes.

This is ideal for:
- Understanding unfamiliar codebases
- Architectural analysis before changes
- Safe exploration of risky operations

Use `/execute` to exit Plan Mode when ready to make changes.
