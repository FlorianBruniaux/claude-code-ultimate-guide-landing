What technique does the Problem Framer command use to find root causes?

---

The Problem Framer command uses the "5 Whys Analysis" technique.

This involves asking "Why?" five times to drill down to the root cause:
- Why 1: First answer
- Why 2: Deeper answer
- Why 3: Even deeper
- Why 4: Getting to root
- Why 5: Root cause

The command then reframes the problem as: "How might we [action] for [user] so that [outcome]?"
