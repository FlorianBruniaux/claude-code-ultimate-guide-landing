What is the 'Explain It Back' technique in the UVAL protocol's Verify step?

---

The rule is simple: if you can't explain the code to a colleague, you don't understand it. This is the verification step - you must be able to articulate WHY the solution works, not just THAT it works. The guide recommends using a /explain-back slash command that asks YOU to explain AI-generated code.
