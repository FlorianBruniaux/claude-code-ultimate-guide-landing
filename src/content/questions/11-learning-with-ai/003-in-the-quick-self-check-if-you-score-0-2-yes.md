In the Quick Self-Check, if you score 0-2 'yes' answers, what does this indicate?

---

A score of 0-2 yes answers indicates dependency risk - you're outsourcing your thinking to AI. The 5 questions test: can you explain AI-generated code, have you debugged without AI, do you know WHY solutions work, could you write the code yourself, do you know AI's limitations. Low scores mean you should read the "Breaking Dependency" section.
