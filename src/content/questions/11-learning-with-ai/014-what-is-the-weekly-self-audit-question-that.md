What is the Weekly Self-Audit question that detects dependency?

---

The key question is: "Am I faster than last month? Am I smarter?" If you're faster but NOT smarter, you're building dependency. Other weekly questions: What did I learn that I didn't know before? Could I have done this without AI? Did I understand everything I shipped?
