In the 30-Day Progression Plan, what is the AI usage ratio for Week 1?

---

Week 1 focuses on foundations with 0-20% AI usage: Days 1-2 build feature WITHOUT AI (0%), Days 4-5 refactor with AI review only (20%), Day 6 debug without AI (0%). The goal is to build (or rebuild) core skills without heavy AI reliance. Success criteria: can explain every line you wrote.
