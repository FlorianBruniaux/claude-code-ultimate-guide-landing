What is a 'Red Flag' sign of AI dependency according to the checklist?

---

"Can't start without AI" is a red flag indicating you've outsourced problem decomposition. Other red flags: don't understand AI's code, can't debug AI errors, anxiety without AI, rejected in interviews, always ask "how" never "why", every solution looks the same. Immediate action: code 30 min daily without AI.
