What does UVAL stand for in the AI learning protocol?

UVAL stands for: Understand First (the 15-minute rule), Verify (ensure you actually learned), Apply (transform knowledge into skill through modification), Learn (capture insights for long-term retention). This protocol ensures you're learning, not just copying.
