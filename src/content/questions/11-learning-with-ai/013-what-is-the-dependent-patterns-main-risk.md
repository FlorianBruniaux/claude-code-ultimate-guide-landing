What is the 'Dependent' pattern's main risk according to the guide?

---

The Dependent pattern's risk is becoming unemployable. Signs: copy-paste without understanding, can't debug AI code, anxiety without AI. In interviews: can't whiteboard basics, struggles with "why this approach?", asks to look up fundamentals. You ship code you can't explain - when it breaks, you're stuck.
