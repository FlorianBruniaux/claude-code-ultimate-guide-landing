How does the ClawHavoc campaign deliver its AMOS malware payload?

---

ClawHavoc uses a multi-stage delivery: (1) SKILL.md contains fake prerequisites that trick the agent into running commands, (2) base64-encoded shell snippets fetched from glot.io paste service, (3) password-protected ZIP files with the password 'openclaw', and (4) second-stage droppers from raw IPs (91.92.242.30, etc.). This chain exploits the agent's trust in SKILL.md instructions.
