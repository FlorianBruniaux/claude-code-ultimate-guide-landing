What should a global CLAUDE.md contain?

---

Global CLAUDE.md (~/.claude/CLAUDE.md) should contain personal preferences that apply to all your projects: communication style (be concise, use code examples), preferred tools (TypeScript over JavaScript, pnpm over npm), and safety rules (always run tests, never force push). Project-specific settings go in project CLAUDE.md.
