What are the three levels of progressive permission in allowedTools?

---

The three progressive permission levels are: Beginner (very restrictive - only Read, Grep, Glob), Intermediate (adds Bash git/pnpm, TodoRead/Write), and Advanced (adds Edit, Write, WebFetch, Task). Start restrictive and expand as you gain confidence. This prevents accidents while learning.
