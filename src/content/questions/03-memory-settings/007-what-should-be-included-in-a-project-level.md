What should be included in a project-level CLAUDE.md file?

---

Project CLAUDE.md should include: tech stack (frameworks, versions), code conventions (naming, patterns), architecture (folder structure, layers), and common commands (dev, test, lint). This gives Claude project context. Never include API keys or secrets. Keep it concise with examples, and update when conventions change.
